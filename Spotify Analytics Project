# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
#Then I explored the data with the following questions.

1. What is the average dancebility by artist?

Select distinct artist_name, AVG(danceability)
from Spotifydata
Group By artist_name
Order By AVG(danceability) desc

2. What are track ids for the songs that have SZA on them?

Select artist_name, track_name, track_id
From Spotifydata
Where artist_name LIKE "%SZA%" 
OR track_name Like "%SZA%"

3. What are the top ten most popular songs in this table?

Select artist_name, track_name, popularity
From Spotifydata
Having MAX(popularity)
Order by popularity desc
Limit 10

4. What songs in this table dont have a 4/4 time signature?

Select artist_name, track_name, time_signature
From Spotifydata
Where time_signature <> "4"
Group By track_name
 

5. How many spots does Olivia Rodrigo have on this list?

Select Count(id) as rows 
From Spotifydata
Where artist_name = "Olivia Rodrigo"

6. What is the average duration of the top ten songs on this list?
